5d. Type of mydf is a list. Type of mydfplayers is a data.frame. 

6.4 Type of df1 is a data.frame.
    Type of df is a SparkDataframe. 
    
6.5 It shows an error message "Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable):unable to find an inherited method for function ‘select’ for signature ‘"data.frame", "NULL"’"

  The reason for this may be the df1 is a dataframe but a SparkDataframe. SparkR could not read dataframe. 
  
6.6 It shows an error message "Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable):unable to find an inherited method for function ‘filter’ for signature ‘"data.frame", "logical"’"

  The reason for this may be the df1 is a dataframe but a SparkDataframe. SparkR could not read dataframe.
