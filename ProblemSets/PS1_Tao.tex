\section{Introduction}
The thing made me want to take this class is that I want to learn something more about how to use different productivity software effectively to solve different problems in real life. Although there are a lot of productivity software available to me, I still do not know which one is good for solving which type of problem. So, I need learn more about those software in order to use it effectively. 

I do not have any idea for what I would want to do for my project for this class. But I may want to do this project to solve some problems that are interesting. There are a lot of topics about this project can be chosen, and I still want to consider more about this topic. I want to make this project as good as I can. 

My goal to this class is to try my best to learn something useful to me. I am not only take this class as credits for my major, but also want to learn something useful. It may helps me to solve some problems in real life. 

My plan for after graduation is to find a job that is good to me.
