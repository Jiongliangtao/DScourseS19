\section{Question 3}
tweets.df <- twListToDF(tweets) 

Let tweets show as a dataframe. 

tweets.df2 <- gsub("http.*","",tweets.dfStext)
tweets.df2 <- gsub("https.*","",tweets.df2)
tweets.df2 <- gsub("#.*","",tweets.df2)
tweets.df2 <- gsub("@.*","",tweets.df2)
tweets.df2 <- gsub("RT","",tweets.df2)

Removing hashtag , urls and other special charactersR.

data <- data.frame(tweets = as.character(tweets.df2), 
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
                   
Convert it to a data frame with string variables instead of a factor variable.

data <- data %>% 
    unnest-tokens(word, tweets)
    
Tokenize the tweets into words.
